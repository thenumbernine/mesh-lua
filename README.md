Mesh library for LuaJIT.

[Demo](https://thenumbernine.github.io/glapp/?file=view.lua&dir=%2Fmesh&args=%5B%22meshes%2Fcube.obj%22%5D&edit=true)

Includes the prototype work I did for [softwarelabs-au](https://github.com/softwarelabs-au/) to develop a mesh tiling algorithm that improves upon what most 3D editors have to offer, which they refused to pay my last paycheck, so here it is for everyone to enjoy.

- TODO replace the `matrix_ffi{4,4}` stuff with `vec4x4f`
