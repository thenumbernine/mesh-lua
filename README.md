Work I did for [softwarelabs-au](https://github.com/softwarelabs-au/) to develop a mesh tiling algorithm that improves upon what most 3D editors have to offer.

This is the rapidly developed prototype written in LuaJIT (takes a fraction of the time to write and design and debug but with negligible performance loss).
